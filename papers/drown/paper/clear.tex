We discovered a vulnerability in recent
(but not current) versions of the OpenSSL SSLv2 handshake code that
creates a powerful Bleichenbacher oracle, and drastically reduces the amount
of computation required to implement our attack.  
The vulnerability, which has been designated CVE-2016-0703, was
present in the OpenSSL codebase from at least the start of the repository,
in 1998, until it was unknowingly fixed on March 4, 2015 by a
patch~\cite{openssl-clear-patch} designed to correct an unrelated
problem~\cite{CVE-2015-0293}.
By adapting DROWN to
exploit this special case, we can cut the number of connections
required by more than 50\% and reduce the computational work to a negligible amount.

%To distinguish the two, we call the attack developed so far
%\emph{general} DROWN and refer to the variant that
%exploits the OpenSSL bug as \emph{special} DROWN\@.  General DROWN is
%a protocol-level attack that makes few assumptions about the SSLv2
%server, other than that it allows export cipher handshakes.  Special
%DROWN exploits a specific implementation bug, but it is highly practical.
%It may be the first widespread Bleichenbacher vulnerability within reach of ``script-kiddies'' and other low-resource
%attackers.

%% This dramatic discovery came too late to fully incorporate into the
%% body of our submission, so for now we confine the bulk of the
%% discussion to this section.
