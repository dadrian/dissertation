We have presented a novel cross-protocol attack on TLS and RSA cipher suites,
affecting XY\% of TLS servers as of the time of writing.
We have demonstrated the attack feasibility, and analyzed several of its performance metrics.

One of the components of this attack is an improved version of Bleichenbacher's attack.
Another component is a highly optimized implementation of a brute force attack against
export RC2 and MD5.

We also discuss an extension of the attack to the QUIC protocol,
and point to properties in other modern protocols that may lead to similar attacks.

Finally, we point out that this attack is yet another instance where an attack
targets obsolete and/or deliberately weakened, yet widely deployed cryptography,
long after better cryptographic alternatives are available.
