\section{Logistics Stuff - temporary}
This is just a temporary place to scribble down todo items.

\todo{Paper submissions should be at most 13 typeset pages, excluding bibliography and well-marked appendices. These appendices may be included to assist reviewers who may have questions that fall outside the stated contribution of the paper on which your work is to be evaluated or to provide details that would only be of interest to a small minority of readers. There is no limit on the length of the bibliography and appendices, but reviewers are not required to read any appendices so the paper should be self-contained without them. Once accepted, papers must be reformatted to fit in 18 pages, including bibliography and any appendices.}

\subsection{Paper todos}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Move ciphersuite selection bug to Measurements
	\item Describe the Leaky Export oracle in the special drown section
	\item Describe the improvement of Leaky Export on QUIC in the signature forgery section
\end{itemize}
