\chapter{Introduction}

General introduction. Broad claims. Thesis statement.

No one will actually read past here.

\section{Engineering Challenges}

To do science, we have to collect data.

To collect the data, we have to build things.

Determining what to build and how to build is also difficult.

Engineering is very closely related to methodology, which is where the science is.

\subsection{Speed}

Assume we're using scanning.

TLS-Attacker is slow.

Performance matters, especially once you start cross-correlating.

Discovery and collection separate. (ZMap vs ZGrab)

\subsection{Data Processing}

Beyond collecting data, you actually have to process it.

Straightforward for one-off studies.

What if you want longitudinal data?

Take-away: This all requires work.

\section{Large-scale Empiriscism}

Some people study cryptograpy usages in individual programs~/cite{most-dangerous-code-2012}.

API design helps.

But ultimately, what is happening? Are we impacting the security on the web as a whole?

But what about ecosystems?

Study usage across ecosystems.

Usage is configuration.

Design experiments to glean information into configuration.

Talk about configuration of the ecosystem beyond just configuration of hosts (cross-protocol correlation).

\subsection{Cryptography in the TLS Ecosystem}

Configuration of web servers.

Logjam.

Diffie-Hellman. Subgroup.

RFC 5114

\subsection{Unexpected Interactions in Cryptography at Scale}

SSLv2 affects TLS

DROWN

Generalize DROWN to cross-protocol key reusage

\paragraph{Export Cryptography}
Don't weaken cryptography.

Takeaways from Black Hat talk.
