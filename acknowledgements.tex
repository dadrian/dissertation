There are many people to thank; these people will be thanked in the final
dissertation. Until then, I'd like to thank my advisor, J.~Alex Halderman,
for putting up with my unique path into and out of the program, both as a
Master's and a Ph.D.\. student. I've learned tremendous amount over the last
five years, and I will never forget my time as your student. I'd also like to
thank Peter Honeyman for helping push me towards the door, and the rest of my
commitee---Chris Peikert and Florian Schaub---for agreeing to be a part of
this.

The work in this dissertation was supported in part by the National Science
Foundation and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, with additional support from
the Mozilla Foundation, Supermicro, Google, Cisco, and the Morris Wellman
Professorship.
